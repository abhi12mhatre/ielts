            IELTS is accepted by over 10,000 organizations, including universities, schools, employers, and immigration
            authorities in more than 140 countries.<br><br>

        <h3>Reading Strategies</h3>
        <p>
            Skimming and Scanning<br>
            These techniques help you quickly identify important information in a text by focusing on keywords and headings.<br><br>

            Identifying the Writer's Purpose<br>
            Understanding the author's intent will help you answer questions more accurately and efficiently. Watch out for
            rhetorical devices!<br><br>

            Eliminating Wrong Answers<br>
            By process of elimination, you can increase your chance of choosing the correct answer. Cross out answers you know
            to be incorrect.

        <h3>Writing Tips and Techniques</h3>
        <p>
            Structure<br>
            Organize your essay with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Use transition words to connect ideas
            and make your writing flow.<br><br>

            Practice<br>
            The key to improving your writing is practice. Try to write every day and have someone read and critique your work.
            Use online resources to find sample questions and responses.<br><br>

            Vocabulary and Grammar<br>
            Use a variety of vocabulary and sentence structures to demonstrate your language proficiency. Avoid common errors

        <p>
            Fluency<br>

            possible. Record yourself and listen for areas to improve.<br><br>

            Pronunciation<br>
            Don't worry about having a perfect British or American accent, but make sure you are pronouncing words clearly and

            Time Management<br>
            Practice answering questions within the allotted time. Don't spend too much time on one question and make sure you
            have time to answer all parts of the speaking test.
